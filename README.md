Cascade is a Luau UI library based on macOS Sequoia.

![Cascade](assets/cascade_show_sequoia.png)

## The Pitch

Cascade is a retained-mode, user-centric UI library designed to be both easy for developers and beautiful for users. Its API is fully typed, so once you learn one component, you can use 99% of the rest without needing to reference the documentation.

Cascade was designed from the ground up as a superior design paradigm. It combines simplicity and customizability into a high level bloat-free API, enabling developers to build polished software-grade UIs in minutes.

## Usage

Reference the [Cascade documentation](https://biggaboy212.github.io/Cascade/) for more.
